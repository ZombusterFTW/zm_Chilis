These files are most of the script files that run Chili's many side EE's. A lot of the code is very spaghetti like but that really is attributed 
to me learning to script when I began writing the code for many of these EEs.
If you are looking for the actual map script files and some other files that aren't available here, check out another repository I posted called chilis map specific script
files. Couldn't figure out how to combine both repositiories lol.
